# ChaosKit
A library for chaos theory based analysis and prediction of time series

This is an updated version of the software used in my 1996 PhD thesis: [Time series prediction using supervised learning and tools from Chaos theory](https://www.academia.edu/466858/Time_series_prediction_using_supervised_learning_and_tools_from_chaos_theory).
